## 2FA for GNU Social / postActiv
(This plugin is written by sstjohn (https://git.gnu.io/sstjohn) Not by me - I just ripped it out of the merge request that has been sitting for over a year so that others can use it right away.)


This plugin allows users to secure their accounts using two-factor
authentication. Upon completion of primary (username/password) authentication,
so-enabled accounts are required to provide secondary authentication before
access is granted. There are several secondary authentication mechanisms
implemented.


FIDO 2.0
========
The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) 2.0 authenticator allows users to authenticate
using a FIDO 2.0 credential, such as is provided by Windows Hello.

As of April 2016, the only browser known to support the FIDO 2.0 standard is 
Microsoft Edge.

TOTP
====
The Time-based One-Time Password authenticator allows users to authenticate
using a TOTP generator, such as FreeOTP or Google Authenticator. For more
information about TOTP, please refer to RFC 6238.

U2F
===
The Universal 2nd Factor authenticator allows users to authenticate using 
FIDO U2F hardware keys. For more information about the FIDO Alliance or their 
Universal 2nd Factor specification, please refer to https://fidoalliance.org.

As of March 2016, the only browser known to support U2F is Chrome. Progress 
towards U2F support in Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox can be observed at 
the following URLs:

 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1065729

Backup Passwords
================
A set of random one-time use passwords can be generated and recorded by the 
user offline, allowing emergency and recovery access to the account.

Application Passwords
=====================
API access by username/password login is prevented for accounts requiring
secondary authentication for failing to meet that requirement. As such,
client application such as andStatus may fail to log in when the requirement 
is enabled for an account.

To grant access to such applications, an application-specific password may
be generated and stored in the client. These passwords are long, random strings
which do not permit web access, and are individually revocable in the case of
client compromise.


Installation
============
add "addPlugin('TwoFactorAuth');" to the bottom of your config.php
